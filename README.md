# Holo :

Holo is a first attempt to enable hologram display on web browsers.
The current execution is responsive to leapmotion device [as seen on this youtube video.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=plufm_x0fNM), we have added a mouse conrolle to enable tests without leapmotion.

This project is now a proof of fesability, though for a better rendering, flexibility and usability a new project is bieng built to provide an easy to use framework so everyone can create web holograms (link tba soon).
